Theme-Original with Data Science
================================

## About 

This repo is forked from the original theme to be used as a boiler plate. The notes are to be published as soon as they are ready. Each note can handle voice files, image files, other attachments. Publishing happens by tagging #published and then synching notes with postach.io. 

We have created this space to start getting familiar with communicating results. There is currently only one section to the web: **Blog**. We will add more topics, which are _Lab_ and _Design_. Perhaps IFTT recipes, which we definitely need to figure out as we go over the how-to and guide to getting started. 

Data for the posts come from Evernote, Pocket, and Dropbox. (Plus, the team is growing something more interesting.)

The site's name has been changed from Data Science to coconut this week. I think we are at __Version 0.8__ and we have about one more month to complete site map.  

## Getting Started

This theme uses LESS for CSS precompiling, and it uses Gulp for compiling the LESS into CSS, and also for concatenating and minifying JavaScript files.

_Note: You do not need LESS and Gulp to use this theme, you can just edit the CSS directly if you like. LESS and Gulp are for advanced users._

### 1) Install Node Modules

Run the following command in Terminal to install Gulp for LESS preprocessing.
```
npm install
```

### 2) Run Gulp

Run gulp to make sure all CSS and JavaScript files are the latest versions.
```
gulp
```
